# Which event listener is used to handle form submissions in JavaScript?
1. Document Manipulation with JavaScript
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to enhance proficiency in manipulating HTML documents dynamically using JavaScript, focusing on the manipulation of arrays and objects to modify document content and structure.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a web page that dynamically updates its content based on user interaction. The page should utilize JavaScript to manipulate the document structure and content using arrays and objects.

Task 1: Create an array containing information about different products, including their names, prices, and descriptions.

let products = [
    { name: "Laptop", price: 999.99, description: "Powerful computing on the go" },
    { name: "Smartphone", price: 699.99, description: "Stay connected wherever you are" },
    { name: "Headphones", price: 149.99, description: "Immersive audio experience" }
];
Task 2: Write a function to display the product information on the webpage dynamically.

Task 3: Implement an event listener to trigger the display of products when the page loads.

Expected Outcomes:

Successful creation of an array containing product information.
Proper display of product information on the webpage using JavaScript.
Implementation of an event listener to trigger the display of products upon page load.




2. Form Manipulation with JavaScript
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to practice manipulating HTML forms dynamically using JavaScript, with a focus on handling arrays, objects, and form elements to capture user input and modify form behavior.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a web page containing a form that allows users to input their information. The page should utilize JavaScript to dynamically handle form submissions, store input data in arrays and objects, and modify form behavior based on user interaction.

Task 1: Create an HTML form with input fields for the user's name, email, and message.

Task 2: Write JavaScript code to handle form submissions and store user input in an object.

Task 3: Implement form validation to ensure that all required fields are filled before submission.

Expected Outcomes:

Successful creation of an HTML form with input fields for name, email, and message.
Proper handling of form submissions using JavaScript to capture user input and store it in an object.
Implementation of form validation to ensure that all required fields are filled before submission.




3. Styling with JavaScript
Objective: The objective of this assignment is to practice manipulating CSS styles dynamically using JavaScript. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to apply various styling changes to HTML elements based on user interaction or other events.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with creating a web page that demonstrates dynamic styling using JavaScript. The page should include HTML elements that change their appearance in response to user actions or events triggered by JavaScript functions.

Task 1: Create an HTML structure with at least 5 elements that will be styled dynamically.

<div id="box" onclick="changeColor()">Click me to change color</div>
Task 2: Write JavaScript code to dynamically change the color of the box element when clicked.

Task 3: Implement additional styling changes based on user interaction, such as mouse hover effects or button clicks on different HTML elements.

Expected Outcomes:

The HTML structure includes an element (e.g., a box) that responds to user interaction.
JavaScript code successfully changes the color of the box element when clicked, providing a visual feedback mechanism.
Additional styling changes, such as mouse hover effects or button clicks, are implemented to enhance user experience and engagement.
NOTE: Ensure that all code in your file is ready to run. This means that if someone opens your HTML file that is linked to your JavaScript file, all code executes as intended. For example, if there are if statements, console.logs, or for loops, they should function correctly and display output in the console as expected. If you have a function, make sure the function is called and runs. If there are classes/objects, make sure they are instantiated and the methods are called.

The goal of this note is to ensure that all code in your Python file runs smoothly and that is has been tested.
